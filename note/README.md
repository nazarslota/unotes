utilizing [gRPC Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway) for HTTP/REST endpoint compatibility
and [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for API documentation. It also integrates with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
for data storage and [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for easy deployment.
